# practice_predict_price

Everything is under cooking, just a experimental project for making money by deep learning.

Try to crawl :

	a. Noble Metals History Price
	b. Exchange Rate History
	c. Global Stock-Index History
	d. TBD (maybe some informantions from the Social Media)

Try to predict : TBD

Note : We need trading volume as well

Finished Items :

	a. Crawl - Noble Metals (Shell Script Only, need to install w3m for parsing html)

TODO :

	a. Crawl - Exchange Rate
	b. Crawl - Global Stock-Index
	c. deside the format of these data
	d. design the target market that we want to predict
	f. implementation of deep learning
		1. implement - data input
		2. implement - learing model
		3. training
		4. implement - prediction
		5. implement - validation

That's all~ Good Luck
